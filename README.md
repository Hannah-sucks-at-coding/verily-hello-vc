Hello T9Hacks! Welcome to Verily's Introduction to Version Control talk. Today, we'll be walking you through the basics of how to use Github for Version control.

## Prerequisite: Sign up for a Github account and install Git

Git installation: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

## Make a repo

<!-- TODO add screenshots -->

1. Click on the plus icon in the upper right.
2. Click on new repository.
3. Pick a repository name and add a description.

**NOTE:** Remember to make your repository name short, concise, and descriptive. You'll thank yourself later!

4. Pick a privacy setting (recommended to pick 'Public' for this activity).
5. Initialize the repo.

  - Adding a README provides space for documenting what your code will do.
  - Adding a .gitignore file ensures you don't accidentally commit files you didn't want to.
  - Open source licensing is optional for this activity. We've added a link to the extra credit if you'd like to learn more.

6. Click on "Create repository". Your finished product should look like this:

## Clone this repo locally

## Make a branch

## Make a commit

## Resolve a merge conflict

## Submit a pull request
- (submission steps)
- (CI/CD flow)

## Find a friend to approve your pull request!

## Merge your PR

## Extra credit
- Create a private repo and add a friend to it.
- Open source licensing link: <>
